# First-HTML-web
Welcome to my first HTML web project! This project is a hands-on learning experience where I explore the fundamentals of HTML (Hypertext Markup Language) and build my very first website.

Project Overview
The purpose of this project is to gain a solid understanding of HTML and its various elements, as well as the basics of web development. I will be creating a simple website that showcases my newly acquired skills and knowledge.
